# @summary Installs and configures S3fs-fuse in order to mount S3 buckets.
#
# @param aws_access_key
#   The access key for AWS.
#
# @param secret_access_key
#   The secret key for AWS.
#
# @param s3fs_version
#   The version of the s3fs.
#
#   @see https://github.com/s3fs-fuse/s3fs-fuse
#
# @param include_mime_package
#   Installs mime which is a requirement to build; however,
#   if this is used with the puppetlabs/apache module, a duplicate
#   resource error will occur even when using ensure_packages.
#   So if mime_support package is declared outside, set this to false.
#
# @param use_system_package
#   If the system being deployed already has s3fs in the repos, use this flag.
